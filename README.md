# Arduino Processing Projects
The Arduino code is written and uploaded through the [PlatformIO extension in VS Code](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode). 
To enable uploading through the Arduino IDE, remove the line `#include <Arduino.h>` in the `main.cpp` files and change the extension from `.cpp` to `.ino`.
