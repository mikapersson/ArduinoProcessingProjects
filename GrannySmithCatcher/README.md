## Future Improvements
+ Use a `keyPressed` handler

+ Introduce a `restart game` option during gameplay

+ Move `switch` state contents to methods outside `draw`

+ Use `width` and `height` in the positioning of all `draw` elements in order for the program
    to be compatible with other screen sizes than my own :)
  
+ Single player mode

+ Detect the COM port automatically in Processing

+ Add background music
